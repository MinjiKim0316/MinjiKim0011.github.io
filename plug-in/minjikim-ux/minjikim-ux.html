          <h3>Step1: Interview</h3>
          <p>
            <span><b>User1: 20s female (friend)</b></span><br><br>
            Q1) How was the corporation’s application when you tried it? <br>
            A)	It was fine but there were some difficulties to try it.<br><br>
            Q2) What were the pain points?<br>
            A)	There were two difficulties.<br>
            First, there was no button to go back to home when I needed.
            Second, I wanted to use the app without logged in. But it required me to sign in if I wanted to use the app.<br><br>
            Q3) What about design? How was it?<br>
            A)	The design was simple and fine.<br><br>
            Q4) Is there anything you would like to excuse?<br>
            A)	Well~ just only the difficulties I mentioned before and that’s all.<br><br><br><br>
            <span><b>User2: 30s male (family)</b></span><br><br>
            Q1) How was the corporation’s application when you tried it?<br>
            A)	It looked fine but there were some problems for users.<br><br>
            Q2) What were the pain points?<br>
            A)	First, as a user and as an employee working in a certain company, there were lots of unnecessary sections and contents existed. <br>
            Second, there was no home button. There were “Back” and “Close” buttons. But these buttons were not enough and it made me feel uncomfortable.<br>
            Last, when I used date section for a trip plan, it was pretty confused and it was difficult to understand why if the corporation made period part on date section because it was not helpful.<br><br>
            Q3) You said, “there were lots of unnecessary sections and contents existed”. What did you mean here?<br>
            A)	I meant when you introduced or explained about a place, description such as its location (address), numbers of rooms and bathroom, items (stuff) in the place would be enough. However, the app explained too much unnecessary information. I felt it was annoying.<br><br>
            Q4) Okay. Then, what about design? How was it?<br>
            A)	Overall, it was pretty fine. But, once you open the corporation’s website using your smartphone, you will see “search” section on the top. Since it was located on the top, it was a bit invisible.<br><br>
            Q5) Is there anything you would like to excuse?<br>
            A)	Well~ I think I mentioned before will be enough.<br><br><br><br>
            <span><b>User3: 40s female (Relatives)</b></span><br><br>
            Q1) How was the corporation’s application when you tried it?<br>
            A)	It was complicated and uncomfortable<br><br>
            Q2) Why? And How?<br>
            A)	First, there were no home and Wishlist buttons. If there were no Wishlist section, then why the corporation made “like” icons on the pictures for places. I could not understand.<br> 
            Second, I wanted to compare places I liked. But, how to compare? I hoped the corporation made a section to compare places so that I could choose a better place.<br>
            Last, how to choose date? I wanted to select date for a trip. However, it was very complicated. So, I just stopped trying the app here. <br><br>
            Q3) What about design? How was it?<br>
            A)	Design was good.<br><br>
            Q4) Is there anything you would like to excuse?<br>
            A)	Yes, I have one. I could not find rank. I mean if the corporation makes a rank section, it would be great. For instance, places for price; from the cheapest to the highest, places for size; from small or single to huge and double.

          <h3>What I learned while doing my project…</h3>
          <p>
            Doing user research was interesting. Before I did user research, I had a prejudice for perspectives of different generations. Because of their different ages, I expected they would have different issues using the corporation’s website and application. However, the result showed me I was wrong. There were some different issues but most pain points were common. The user research showed me why doing the research was mandatory for UX.<br>
            Also, I was sure I could figure every solution out. While doing user research for my project, I realized there were some issues I needed to co-work with partners though. Likewise, while doing my project, I realized collaborating with partners was mandatory since working on doing research, studying users’ needs based on research, designing, and doing programming alone was overwhelming. Though, doing my UX/UI project has advanced my career growth.
